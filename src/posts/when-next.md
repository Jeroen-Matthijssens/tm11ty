Chase a bus, miss 
Touch something, “this”
Travel deep into abyss
Come up for air—gasp
from a summer long kiss

Stand at a coffee bar
Get in a car
Hold doors ajar
Not stand so far

Pet a fat pug
Cut a damn rug
Get stung by a bug
Hold a long hug

Chase a bus, miss 
Touch something, “this”
Travel deep into abyss
Come up for air—gasp
from a summer long kiss
