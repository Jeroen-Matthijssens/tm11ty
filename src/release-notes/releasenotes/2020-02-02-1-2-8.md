### Content

- Added Media page for podcasts, articles, and interviews.
- Updated About page, adding more helpful context for my work.
- Updated Speaking page with slides, added a few new events!
- Hiding Sponsors page as I assess its future.

### Systems

- Utilised Sass lists to condense and to clarify some verbose code, particularly around generating background colours for front-matter content.
- Fixed some broken `zigzag` components, which were affected by above editing.
- Included shop link in header, learning how to include a static link in with generated nav.
- Updated footer year lmao.
- Deleted some unused code. WOOP!
